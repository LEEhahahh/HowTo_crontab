If you're in Insert mode (after pressing i), you can add content, but deleting existing content works best in Normal mode.
1. Press Esc to exit Insert mode and return to Normal mode.
2. Delete a single character: Move the cursor over the character and press:
   `x`
3. Delete a whole line: Move the cursor to the line and press:
   `dd`
4. Delete multiple lines: e.g. to delete 5 lines:
   `5dd`
5. Delete from cursor to end of line:
   `D`
6. Delete a word: Move the cursor to the beginning of the word and press:
   `dw`
Type :wq and press Enter to write (save) and quit.  
Or type :q! to quit without saving.
